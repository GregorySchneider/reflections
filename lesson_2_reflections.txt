What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden folder .git is created for the repository. Zero commits performs. Run git status to check state and then run git add toi add files to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows you to add multiple files using seperate "add" commands, so you can group files which are related and then "commit" them as a single check in. The working directory will contain both checked in and non checked-in files, it is also the location of the actual repository, which resides in a hidden sub folder ".git".
